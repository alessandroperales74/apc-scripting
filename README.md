Hi, everyone! 

In this repository I'm going to upload some scripts I made in Python (mostly) to make my life a bit easier.

This repository is not meant to be a big project, but rather a collection of standalone code snippets that can be of great utility for anyone who finds themselves doing very manual tasks.
